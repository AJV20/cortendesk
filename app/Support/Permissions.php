/**
 * The single permission vocabulary shared by API tokens (PLAN B1) and
 * delegated console roles (PLAN D4).
 *
 * Levels are stored as `none|r|rw` — the same three strings the api_tokens
 * matrix has always used — and are ordered by increasing capability, so a
 * required level is satisfied by anything ranked at least as high. The console
 * UI *labels* them None / View / Manage; the strings 'view' and 'manage' are
 * never stored.
 *
 * Console roles cover two areas the automation API has no endpoints for
 * (`setting`, `token`), which is why CONSOLE_RESOURCES is a superset of
 * ApiToken::RESOURCES rather than the same list. Widening the API matrix would
 * invent permissions no route reads.
